// Implement a simple REST API with Express framework:

//     Use Pug as a template engine for basic HTML landing page GET / (1 point)
//     Implement a REST API by following this API reference with the mock data included in it (max. 4 points)

//     Continue with the project you created in the previous assignment and create a new branch express for this assignment.
//         use the existing code as a starting point or generate a new project with npm init
//     Install Express framework and Pug template engine
//     Render a dynamic HTML page with Express and Pug
//         provide some information about your API, use dynamic content rendering
//     Implement API endpoints following the API documentation and using the mock data provided
//         note that API documentation is not complete, you need to figure out missing details. for example add correct status codes and corresponding messages or data to the responses
//     Serve static media files from src/media folder
//         use e.g. some small-sized images from Internet
//         match the filenames with the mock data
